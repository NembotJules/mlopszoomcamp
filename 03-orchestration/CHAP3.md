# What is MLOps

Operationalizing ML models involves moving them from development to production to drive business value.

## Step 1

Preparing the model for deployment involves optimizing performance, ensuring it handles real-worl data, and packaging it for integration into existing systems.

## Step 2

Deploying the model involves moving it from development to production, making it accessible to users and applications.

## Step 3

Once deployed, models must be continuously monitored for accuracy and reliability, and may need retraining on new data and updates to maintain effectiveness

## Step 4

The operationalized model must be integrated into existing workflows, applications, and decision-making processes to drive business impact.

> Effective operationalization enables organizatons to move beyond experimentation and drive tangible value from ML at scale, powering intelligent applications that personalize the customer experience and creates real business value.


# Why we need to operationalize ML

## 1. Productivity

MLOps fosters collaboration between data scientists, ML engineers, and DevOps teams by providing a unified environment for experiment tracking, feature engineering, model management, and deployment. This breaks down silos and accelerates the entire machine learning lifecycle.

## 2. Reliability

MLOps ensures high-quality, reliable models in production through clean datasets, proper testing, validation, CI/CD practices, monitoring, and governance.


## 3. Reproducibility

MLOps enables reproducibility and compliance by versioning datasets, code, and models, providing transparency and auditability to ensure adherence to policies and regulations.

## 4. Time-to-value

MLOps streamlines the ML lifecycle, enabling organizations to succesfully deploy more projects to production and derive tangible business value and ROI from AI/ML investments at scale.
